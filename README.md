## Welcome to "Salt To Finish" Git repo!

Many of my blog posts will reference files in this repo. I will upload the full files in this repo for you to look at and so that you can also get a better understanding of how I organized my directory structure.

The "salt" directory in this repo would be my versioned control "salt" project with all of my Salt files. Everything you need would be in this directory.
